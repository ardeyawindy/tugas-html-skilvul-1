        <h1>Hi, my name is Ardeya Windyana</h1>
        <p>My name is Ardeya Windyana, everyone used to call me Windy. I was born in Banyuwangi, 2 September 2002. My life journey was not very interesting. I'm just an ordinary girl who lives in a village in the city of Banyuwangi.</p>
        <p>
          Since I was in elementary school, I have been very interested in technological developments. I spent time in internet cafes since I was 10 years old. Maybe that's one of the many reasons why I'm now majoring in Information Systems
          at the University of Jember.
